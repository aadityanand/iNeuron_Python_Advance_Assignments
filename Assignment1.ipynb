    "A: While doing arithmetic operations of two numpy arrays, there is a chance that they are of different shapes. This leads to difficulty of performing arithmetic operations. To tackle this, numpy broadcasts the smaller array to the size of the bigger array to make the sizes compatible for performing arithmetic operations. "
