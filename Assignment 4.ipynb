    "A: A class is the basis of all data in Python, everything is an object in Python, and a class is how an object is defined. They are the foundation of object-oriented programmingA class is the basis of all data in Python, everything is an object in Python, and a class is how an object is defined. They are the foundation of object-oriented programming. You use a class to instantiate objects, which are specific instances of a class. A class defines the general behavior that an entire category of objects may have as well as the information that can be associated with those objects. Classes can inherit from each other which means you can create a class that extends the functionality of an existing class."
